# The Runaway Bean

A project built with the purpose of improving my design and advanced CSS skills.

During this time, I was still learning how to write good, scalable code. I attempted to implement some of the principles I had learned about writing scalable code in this project, but after coming back to this project several months later to add media queries and other updates, I now realize how poorly I was at executing these principles. My code in this project is admittedly not good, but this project is one I am still proud of and feel it is a good demonstration of my CSS abilities. If I could go back in time, however, I would certainly do a lot of things differently.
